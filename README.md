# Degenerate-Detection
A novel degeneracy detection method is proposed for LIDAR SLAM, based on a point-to-distribution approach. The method introduces a new degeneracy factor by incorporating local geometric model information. Additionally, to ensure the validity of the local geometric information in various scenarios, an efficient voxel segmentation strategy is designed, leveraging the density of the point cloud distribution. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods. Moreover, it effectively mitigates noise interference and reduces the occurrence of false detections.


Code is being organized, stay tuned...
